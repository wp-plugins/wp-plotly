Embed Plotly graphs in wordpress admin.

== Description ==

This plugin is for quick inclusion of interactive Plotly graphs within your Wordpress blog.
It works the same way as YouTube embeds — All you have to do is paste the link to your Plotly graph into Wordpress and the interactive graph will appear.
For example, paste http://plot.ly/~chris/1638 into the Wordpress editor, and the graph with this URL will be displayed.
